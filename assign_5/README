TCP is very easy to check if we have retransmission. We use a tuple of source IP , destination IP,source port, 
destination port and serial and acknowledgement numbers and if a new tcp packet has the same numbers as one that is already created then  we mark it as retransmission.

UDP is a connectionless protocol and this protocol doesnt work with sequence numbers as tcp or acknowledgement numbers in its header 
which means that the retransmissions are not detectable at the transport.
TCP Retransmissions: Detectable by tracking sequence numbers and analyzing flow state.
